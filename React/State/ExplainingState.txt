Essentially react renders fucntions based on what their return values after
this rendering happens in 2 places
1. when a new prop is recieved
2. there is an internval state value onChange
This internal state value change hapepns thorugh a specific state changign function called setState

This means that you wont see any changes when normal local variables change 
ex:
export default function App() {
    let state = "Yes"
    
    function handleClick() {
        state = "Heck yes"
    }
    
    return (
        <main>
            <h1 className="title">Is state important to know?</h1>
            <button onClick={handleClick} className="value">{state}</button>
        </main>
    )
}
You will see that when you end up clicking the button, the text acutally change
