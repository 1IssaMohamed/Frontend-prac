REST=Representation state transfer
Utilzies HTTP methods/verbs:
GET = Read
POST= create
patch = update
delete = destroy 
requests are made in the form of 
verb url
    headers that have the meta data ab the request 
    ex: accept: autorization: connection:
    {
        body which contains the data (which is used if youre creating or updating otherwise in other verbs like get or delete its not xnecessary?)
}

so express is a ndoe frame work that is used to build web servers adn apis
its a layer aroudn node js built in http tha tmakes the routes and request handing much easier
so if nodejs is a screw then expres is the hammer that pushes that screw in
