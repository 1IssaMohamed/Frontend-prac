     * Challenge: clean up our code!
     * Let's make a couple new components to make things a
     * little cleaner. (Notice: I'm not suggesting what we
     * have now is bad or wrong. I'm mostly finding an excuse
     * to get in some hands-on practice ðŸ™‚)
     * 
     * 1. Move the entire recipe <section> into its own
     *    ClaudeRecipe component
     * 2. Move the list of ingredients <section> into its
     *    own IngredientsList component.
     * 
     * While you're considering how to structure things, consider
     * where state is, think about if it makes sense or not to
     * move it somewhere else, how you'll communicate between
     * the parent/child components, etc.
     * 
     * The app should function as it currently does when you're
     * done, so there will likely be some extra work to be done
     * beyond what I've listed above.
